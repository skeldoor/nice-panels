# Loot Calculator Upgrade

The Loot Calculator gets a bunch of new features to give you more control over how drops are displayed.

## Probability Mode

New checkbox to toggle between the original expected quantity view and actual drop probability. Instead of seeing "x 2.05" it'll show you the real percentage chance of getting at least one drop in your kill count, using the formula `1 - (1 - p)^n`. Colour coded too — green for near certain, white for likely, yellow for moderate, red for unlikely.

## Section Filtering

Monsters with multiple sub-tables (like "Weapons and armour", "Seeds", "Rare drop table") now have a **Section** dropdown so you can pull just the one you want instead of seeing every drop lumped together. Works by reading the H3 headings from the wiki page.

## Sort Order

New sort dropdown with five options: Wiki Order (default), Rarest First, Most Common First, Highest Expected First, and Alphabetical.

## Panel Customisation

A handful of new options for making the panel fit your content better:

- **Size Presets** — Full Screen (1920x1080), HD (1280x720), Small (800x600), or default panel width
- **Fixed Height** — Set a specific height or leave at 0 for auto-sizing
- **Columns** — Spread your loot across 1–6 columns, handy for wider panels
- **Title & Background Colours** — Colour pickers for the monster name and panel background

## Fixes

- Panel is now centred on the page instead of aligned to the right
- Removed the old container width cap that was clipping wider panels
