# New Panel: Collection Log

A new tool joins the lineup.

## Collection Log Panel

The **Collection Log** panel lets you create those iconic collection log notification popups. You know the ones — that little message that pops up when you finally get the drop.

- **Three text lines** to customise however you like
- **Colour pickers** for each line so you can match the in-game look or go wild
- **Pixel-perfect export** just like all the other panels

Set your item name, tweak the colours, and download. Perfect for fake drops, memes, video overlays, or just manifesting that pet drop you'll never actually get.

Available to pick from the setup page now.
