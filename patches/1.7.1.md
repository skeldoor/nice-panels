# Collection Log Animation

The Collection Log panel now supports animated exports.

## Animated GIF Export

Hit the new **Save as GIF** button on the Collection Log panel to download an animated version of your notification.

- **Opening/Closing animation** where the panel scales out from the center, X-axis first then Y-axis, just like the in-game popup then plays in reverse after a hold, so the panel shrinks back down the same way it opened.
- **Transparent background** so the GIF drops straight into overlays, videos, or wherever you need it
