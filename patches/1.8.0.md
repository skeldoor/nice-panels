# 1.8.0 Update

Big update across a few panels.

## Loot Calculator

- **Probability Mode** - toggle to show the % chance of getting at least one of each drop in your kill count, colour-coded from green (near certain) to red (unlikely)
- **Section Filtering** - monsters with multiple drop tables now have a Section dropdown so you can filter to specific categories
- **Sorting** - five sort options: wiki order, rarest first, most common first, highest expected first, alphabetical
- **Multi-column layout** with 1 to 6 columns for wider panels

## Dialog Panel

- **Custom chathead upload** - use your own image instead of the wiki chathead
- **Name override** - display a different name from the NPC you searched for

## Infobox Panel

- **RS UF font** added to primary and secondary font options
- **Custom border colour** picker alongside the existing presets
- **Show/hide item holder** toggle

## Icon Creator

- **Drop shadow toggle** with style options: in-game style, solid black, or a custom colour
