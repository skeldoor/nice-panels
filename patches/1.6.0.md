# Choose Your Own Panels

Big changes to how panel access works — you're in control now.

## Pick Your Panels

Instead of being locked to specific panels based on your tier, you now choose which panels you want access to from the full lineup.

- **Basic** — Pick **1 panel** of your choice
- **Enhanced** — Pick **3 panels** of your choice
- **Full** — All panels, no picking needed

When you first log in you'll be prompted to make your selection on a new setup page.

## 12-Hour Grace Period

Not sure about your picks? No worries. After your first selection you've got **12 hours** to change your mind freely. After that, your choice locks in for 30 days — so use that grace window wisely.

## Settings & Countdown

There's a new gear button in the top bar that takes you to your panel setup page. If you're locked in, it'll show how long until you can change your selection again. Full Access users won't see a countdown since all panels are already unlocked.

## Tier Changes

If you upgrade or downgrade your Patreon tier, your panel selection resets automatically so you can pick again with your new allowance. No need to do anything manually.

## Patch Notes

You're looking at them! From now on, when there's an update you'll see a popup like this the first time you visit the site after a new version drops. One and done — it won't keep bugging you.
